#### Description:Browser Sort is a web application that provides users with a convenient way to save their favorite websites in a personalized dashboard. With the ability to easily access saved websites with a single click, users can navigate to frequently visited sites without wasting time browsing. The application is designed with a focus on functionality and ease of use, making it an efficient tool for anyone looking to streamline their browsing experience. The video demo provided showcases the application's user interface and dynamic features that make it stand out from the rest.

The design of Browser Sort was implemented using CSS and Bootstrap, which provide a range of pre-designed components and styles to create an intuitive and visually appealing interface. Bootstrap's responsive layout adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring that the application is accessible on a range of devices. HTML elements are styled using CSS to improve readability and usability. The design is simple and clean, with a focus on functionality and ease of use.

JavaScript was used to add functionality to the application. The dynamic features, such as the ability to add, edit, and delete saved websites, were implemented using JavaScript. The use of JavaScript provides a more interactive and responsive experience for users. The application is designed to be intuitive, with features that are easy to use and navigate. The combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript ensures that the application is fast and responsive, providing a seamless user experience.

Browser Sort can be further developed to include additional features that enhance the user experience. The Dream Big version of the application includes the ability to add/delete websites that are most visited for faster search, icons for websites, the ability to shrink and grow icons, and dark/light mode. These features can be implemented using CSS and JavaScript to provide a more engaging and customizable experience for users. The ability to add/delete websites that are most visited for faster search can help users manage their favorite links more effectively, while icons for websites can improve the visual appeal of the application. The ability to adjust the size of icons and the implementation of a dark/light mode can also help users create a personalized dashboard that suits their needs.

In addition to the Dream Big version, an MVP version of the application can be developed to provide a basic set of features that make it useful. The MVP version can include the ability to add and delete links in a list, with the links working when clicked. This basic functionality can be achieved using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. An array can be used to store the saved links, while an input field and delete button can be used to add and remove links from the list. A place where the user can type in or add a link to a website can also be included.

Once the MVP version of the application is complete, additional features can be added to create a more robust and engaging experience for users. These features can include the ability to organize links into categories, the ability to search for saved links, and the ability to import and export links. These features can be implemented using JavaScript to provide a more interactive and responsive experience for users. The ability to organize links into categories can help users manage their favorite links more effectively, while the ability to search for saved links can save time and improve productivity. The ability to import and export links can also provide users with the ability to transfer their saved links between devices, making the application more convenient to use.

The responsive design of Browser Sort ensures that the application can be used on different screen sizes without compromising functionality or user experience. The use of Bootstrap and CSS also allows for customization options, enabling users to create a personalized dashboard that suits their needs. The user-friendly interface allows users to quickly add, edit, and delete websites, making it easy to manage their favorite links. The combination of dynamic features and responsive design make Browser Sort a valuable tool for anyone looking to streamline their browsing experience.
