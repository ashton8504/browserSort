#### Description:Browser Sort is a web application that can be developed further to include additional features that enhance the user experience. The Dream Big version of the application can include features such as icons for websites, the ability to shrink and grow icons, and dark/light mode. These features can be implemented using CSS and JavaScript to provide a more engaging and customizable experience for users. The use of icons for websites can improve the visual appeal of the application, while the ability to adjust the size of icons can help users create a personalized dashboard that suits their needs. The implementation of a dark/light mode can also enhance the user experience by allowing users to choose their preferred color scheme.

In addition to the Dream Big version, an MVP version of the application can be developed to provide a basic set of features that make it useful. The MVP version can include the ability to add and delete links in a list, with the links working when clicked. This basic functionality can be achieved using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. An array can be used to store the saved links, while an input field and delete button can be used to add and remove links from the list. A place where the user can type in or add a link to a website can also be included.

Once the MVP version of the application is complete, additional features can be added to create a more robust and engaging experience for users. These features can include the ability to organize links into categories, the ability to search for saved links, and the ability to import and export links. These features can be implemented using JavaScript to provide a more interactive and responsive experience for users. The ability to organize links into categories can help users manage their favorite links more effectively, while the ability to search for saved links can save time and improve productivity. The ability to import and export links can also provide users with the ability to transfer their saved links between devices, making the application more convenient to use.

Overall, Browser Sort is a web application that can be developed further to include a range of features that enhance the user experience. The Dream Big version and MVP version of the application provide a starting point for development, with the MVP version providing a basic set of features that make the application useful. With the addition of new features, Browser Sort can become a valuable tool for anyone looking to streamline their browsing experience and make it more efficient and enjoyable.
