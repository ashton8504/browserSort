#### Description:   
  Browser Sort is a web application designed to improve internet browsing by providing a customizable dashboard of frequently visited websites. The application is designed to be user-friendly, with a simple and intuitive interface that allows users to easily add, edit, and delete websites. The application is implemented using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript to provide a seamless user experience.

  One of the key features of Browser Sort is the ability to add and delete websites. Users can easily add a website by entering the URL into the input field and clicking the "Add" button. The website will then be added to the dashboard, with an icon and a label displaying the website name. To delete a website, users can simply click the delete button next to the website they want to remove.

 Another feature of Browser Sort is the ability to customize the size of the icons. Users can easily adjust the size of the icons by using the zoom in and zoom out buttons located in the top right corner of the dashboard. This feature allows users to create a personalized dashboard that suits their needs and preferences.

  In addition to the ability to customize the size of the icons, Browser Sort also includes a dark mode feature. Users can switch between the light and dark mode by clicking on the toggle button located in the top right corner of the dashboard. This feature provides a more comfortable browsing experience for users who prefer darker backgrounds.

  The user interface of Browser Sort is designed to be simple and easy to navigate. The dashboard consists of a grid of icons, with each icon representing a website. The icons are organized in rows and columns, with each row containing a maximum of four icons. This layout provides a clear and organized view of the user's favorite websites.

  The icons used in Browser Sort are designed to be visually appealing and easy to recognize. Each icon is associated with a website, with the icon representing the logo or the main image of the website. The labels used to display the website names are also designed to be easy to read and distinguishable from one another.

  The responsiveness of Browser Sort is another key feature of the application. The dashboard is designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and orientations. This ensures that the application can be used on a range of devices, from desktop computers to mobile phones. The responsive design also allows for a seamless user experience, with no lag or delays when switching between devices.

  The use of Bootstrap in the implementation of Browser Sort provides pre-designed components and styles that are utilized to create a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes. This makes the application scalable, allowing for easy updates and modifications.

  JavaScript is used extensively in Browser Sort to add dynamic features to the application. The ability to add, edit, and delete websites is implemented using JavaScript. JavaScript is also used to provide real-time feedback to users, with notifications appearing when a website is added or deleted.

  The MVP version of Browser Sort includes the ability to add and delete links in a list and have the links work when clicked. This version includes an empty array that allows users to add links to their favorite websites. The input and delete buttons are also included in the MVP version.

  Overall, Browser Sort is a valuable web application that makes browsing the internet more efficient and enjoyable. The application is designed to be user-friendly, with a simple and intuitive interface that allows users to easily add, edit, and delete websites. The combination of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript ensures that the application is fast, responsive, and scalable, providing a seamless user experience. The dynamic features and responsive design make Browser Sort a valuable tool for anyone looking to streamline their browsing experience.
