#### Description:   
  Browser Sort is a web application designed to allow users to create a customized dashboard for their favorite websites. This application is similar to the "Favorites" feature found on web browsers, but with added convenience and customization options. Users can easily access their saved websites with a single click, making it easy to navigate to frequently visited sites without wasting time browsing. The user-friendly interface allows users to quickly add, edit, and delete websites, making it easy to manage their favorite links.

The main purpose of Browser Sort is to simplify the process of accessing frequently visited websites. The application is designed to make it easy for users to save links to their favorite websites and access them quickly with a single click. This saves users time and effort when browsing the internet, allowing them to focus on the content they are interested in, rather than spending time searching for the websites they want to visit.

The design of Browser Sort was implemented using CSS and Bootstrap to create an intuitive and visually appealing interface. Bootstrap provided pre-designed components and styles that were utilized to create a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes. The saved websites are displayed using HTML elements that were styled using CSS to improve readability and usability. The design is simple and clean, with a focus on functionality and ease of use.

JavaScript was used to add functionality to the application. The dynamic features of the application, such as the ability to add, edit, and delete saved websites, were implemented using JavaScript. The use of JavaScript provides a more interactive and responsive experience for users. The application is designed to be intuitive, with features that are easy to use and navigate. The combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript ensures that the application is fast and responsive, providing a seamless user experience.

One of the key features of Browser Sort is its accessibility on a range of devices, from desktop computers to mobile devices. The responsive design ensures that the application can be used on different screen sizes without compromising functionality or user experience. The use of Bootstrap and CSS also allows for customization options, enabling users to create a personalized dashboard that suits their needs. This means that users can access their favorite websites from any device, making it easy to stay connected and productive on the go.

Another valuable feature of Browser Sort is the ability to customize the appearance of the dashboard. Users can choose from different color schemes, font sizes, and other design elements to create a personalized look and feel. This means that users can create a dashboard that reflects their personality and style, making it a more enjoyable and engaging experience.

In addition to the design and customization features, Browser Sort also offers advanced functionality that allows users to organize their favorite websites in a variety of ways. For example, users can sort their websites by category or importance, or arrange them in a particular order. This means that users can tailor their browsing experience to their specific needs, making it more efficient and productive.

To create an MVP version of Browser Sort, the minimum features needed to make the application useful are a list of saved links, an input field for adding new links, and a delete button to remove unwanted links. This simple version of the application provides users with a basic set of tools for managing their favorite websites. Although it lacks the advanced features of the full version of Browser Sort, it is still a valuable tool for anyone looking to streamline their browsing experience.

Overall, Browser Sort is a useful web application that makes browsing the internet more efficient and enjoyable. It was developed using a combination of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript to ensure a responsive and user-friendly experience. The application is designed with a focus on functionality and ease of use, providing users with an intuitive and customizable dashboard for their favorite websites. The dynamic features and responsive design make Browser Sort a valuable tool for anyone looking to streamline their browsing experience. Whether you're a casual web surfer or a busy professional
