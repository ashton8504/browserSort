Browser Sort has the potential to be a useful tool
Dream Big Version:

- Ability to add/delete websites that are most visited for faster search
- Icons for websites 
- Ability to be able to shrink and grow Icons
- Dark/Light Mode


An MVP version (one with the minimum features that make it useful): 

- Ability to add/delete links in a list && have links worked when clicked

Breakdown of MVP Version:

- Array (Empty array to be able to add/delete items)
- input/delete button
- A place where user can type in and/or add link to website 



POSSIBLE IDEAS:

Reorder list
see or edit the URL for each added item (imagine this could be useful for bookmarking multiple links to the same website but different pages)
Custom icons
Export list
Import list
Those are random things users just asked for and as PM job you have to decide what if any to prioritize
